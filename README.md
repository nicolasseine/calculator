# calculator

My second project for [The Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project), using HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript.

My goal was to recreate a cheap calculator, with all the blinking screen effects. 
It is fully functional, with keyboard support. I will probably add some easter eggs later.
